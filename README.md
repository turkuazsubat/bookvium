# Digital Book Archive & Information Site

This project is a comprehensive digital archive and information website based on books I have previously consulted. I am developing every part of the project myself.

The project is currently under development, and new features and content will be added over time. It is licensed as closed source and will eventually be published on its own dedicated website.

**Note:** The project is currently undergoing minor adjustments and improvements. Updates will continue regularly.
